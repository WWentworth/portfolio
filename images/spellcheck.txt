So, I have been playing a lot of games on board game arena lately. One game in particular I've been enjoying is Chocolate factory. 
For those that do not know, chocolate factory is a drafting engine builder where the player is running a factory to produce and sell various types of chocolate. 
Each round players will take turns choosing a part of the factory to expand and a worker who have different benefits as well as decide which store you can sell to. 

-I like that the game makes me feel like I'm actually running a factory, the chocolate sits on moving pieces that act as the conveyor system moving chocolate from one machine to the next.

-Outside of drafting at the beginning of each round, players will operate their factories at the same time which is nice for people who like to stay active and not wait on other peoples turns

-Drafting is the only real interaction between players
